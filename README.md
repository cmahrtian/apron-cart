# apron-cart

Enjoy my submission to the WS Markup Challenge. I look forward to your review and your feedback.

## Build Setup

Open up a terminal window and navigate to a directory of your choosing, then run ```git clone``` followed by either the SSH or HTTPS address of this repo. Navigate into your newly created **apron-cart** directory and run the pair of commands below: 

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

Open up a new tab or window in the browser of your choosing and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the following appear in your browser:
